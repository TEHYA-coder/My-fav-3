            <p id="para1">Bellatrix Lestrange (née black) is my favourite charecter. She is from the fantasy novel collection of Harry Potter by Joanne Kathleen Rowling. Actually Bellatrix is a villain but her looks and power is what I like about her. Here is some information abput her:
                <br> <br>
                Bellatrix was born in 1951 to Cygnus Black III and Druella Rosier, who gave her a rich lifestyle and raised her to be proud of her pure-blood heritage. She was the elder sister of Andromeda Tonks (née Black) and Narcissa Malfoy (née Black). Bellatrix attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was Sorted into Slytherin House, a patron followed by her sisters. Along with the rest of her family who held pureblood supremacy beliefs, Bellatrix cut off contact with Andromeda when she married Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, causing her to be disowned from the House of Black. Neither she or Narcissa had "set eyes on Andromeda since she married the Mudblood Tonks". She also held her cousin Sirius Black in contempt for being a "blood traitor" due his different opinions on Muggles and Muggle-borns. Bellatrix eventually married Rodolphus Lestrange, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and Slytherin, marrying out of obligation of fulfilling her family’s pro pure-blood mentality and tradition, Unlike her sisters, she never displayed any affection for her husband whatsoever, never even mentioning him in conversations nor bearing him any children. When Lord Voldemort first rose to power, Bellatrix and Rodolphus joined the Death Eaters.

        <p>Throughout the books, Bellatrix is referred to as being one of Lord Voldermort’s most loyal supporters. She was sent to Azkaban for torturing Alice and Frank Longbottom (Neville’s parents) into insanity under his command and spent several years in Azkaban until there was a mass prison breakout arranged by Voldermort. Although Bellatrix was married to Rodolphus it was never a marriage of love just of duty. She felt she needed to marry a pureblood because of family tradition but her true love was only ever Lord Volvdermort but it is unlikely he felt the same way as he has proven himself incapable of feeling love. This is suggestive of her personality and behaviour because it is shown throughout the books and films that Bellatrix was mentally unstable.In the books she is described as “mad”, “fanatical” and “ruthless” – all perfect traits for a villain worthy of Lord Voldermorts approval.
        <br> <br>
        Bella (her nickname) is palyed by actor Helena Bonham Carter ( also known for her role as Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland). The charceter Bellatrix surprisingly is very popular even if she is a villain.
